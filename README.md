# PixelSorter

Written for Processing 3

By Brandon Izor

Special thanks to Daniel Shiffman for excellent instructional videos!

Uses Processing to pixelsort images using quicksort. Optionally, you can blend the sorted output with the original input to make images cooler.

Note: Things get a little nasty with small images, as well as images larger than ~3000x3000. 
I'll fix this at some point, but for now, the "sweet spot" is conveniently around 1920x1080..
